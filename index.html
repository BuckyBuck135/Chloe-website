		<h2> A short biography</h2>
		<p> I was born in Australia, sometime in 2017. I had a rough life until Janice and Geoffrey, sorry I mean Mommy and Daddy adopted me. "Mommy's sweet little Chlo babe". It's what she calls me all the time. And I like it.</p>

		<h2>My favorite foods</h2>
			<p>Here's a list of my favorite foods in the world. Of course, I only get these on special occasions. I usually have to follow a strict diet of dry biscuits. Ewww...</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Roast chicken</li>
				<li>Dine treats</li>
				<li>Felix</li>

					<li>Sleep in the walk-in closet</li>
					<li>Play with my toys</li>
					<li>Scratch the couch ^^</li>
